BLUE TEAM DEFINITION:

## 

During cyber security testing engagements, blue teams evaluate organizational security environments and defend these environments from red teams. These red teams play the role of attackers by identifying security vulnerabilities and launching attacks within a controlled environment. Both teams combine to help illuminate the true state of an organization’s security.

The idea that you can better understand your defenses by attacking them in a controlled environment is a long-established military principle. This idea is most commonly expressed in the practice of “red teaming,” where an outside group of independent actors tests the systems or defenses of a target organization to identify any existing vulnerabilities.

In the world of information security, the practice of red teaming is now well established. Red teams, who act as “ethical hackers,” methodically study an organization’s structure and defenses and then launch attacks to exploit any weaknesses.

Yet red teams are only part of the equation. On the other side stand “blue teams” — security professionals who are tasked with defending an organization’s systems and assets against attacks, both real and simulated.

### Siem and Soc

## What is a SOC (Security Operations Center)?

## 

A [security operations center](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-soc/) (SOC) is responsible for protecting an organization against cyber threats. SOC analysts perform round-the-clock monitoring of an organization’s network and investigate any potential security incidents. If a cyberattack is detected, the SOC analysts are responsible for taking any steps necessary to remediate it.

## What is SIEM

## 

Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) is a set of tools and services offering a holistic view of an organization’s information security.

## SIEM: An Invaluable Tool for a SOC Team

## 

SOC analysts need a variety of tools to perform their role effectively. They need to have deep visibility into all of the systems under their protection and to be able to detect, prevent, and remediate a wide range of potential threats.

The complexity of the networks and security architectures that SOC analysts work with can be overwhelming. SOCs commonly receive tens or hundreds of thousands of security alerts in a single day. This is far more than most security teams are capable of effectively managing.

A security information and event management ([SIEM](https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/cyber-security/what-is-siem-security-information-and-event-management/)) solution is intended to take some of the burden off of SOC analysts. SIEM solutions aggregate data from multiple sources and use data analytics to identify the most probable threats. This enables SOC analysts to focus their efforts on the events most likely to constitute a real attack against their systems.

## Advantages of SIEM Systems

## 

A SIEM can be an invaluable tool for a SOC team. Some of the primary benefits of SIEM solutions include:

-   Log Aggregation: A SIEM solution will integrate with a wide variety of different endpoints and security solutions. It can automatically collect the log files and alert data that they generate, translate the data into a single format, and make the resulting datasets available to SOC analysts for incident detection and response and threat hunting activities.
-   Increased Context: In isolation, most indications of a cyberattack can be easily dismissed as noise or benign abnormalities. Only by correlating multiple data points does a threat become detectable and identifiable. SIEMs’ data collection and analytics help to provide the context required to identify more subtle and sophisticated attacks against an organization’s network.
-   Reduced Alert Volume: Many organizations use an array of security solutions, which creates a deluge of log and alert data. SIEM solutions can help to organize and correlate this data and identify the alerts most likely to be related to true threats. This enables SOC analysts to focus their efforts on a smaller, more curated set of alerts, which reduces the time wasted on false positive detections.
-   Automated Threat Detection: Many SIEM solutions have built-in rules to help with the detection of suspicious activity. For example, a large number of failed login attempts to a user account may indicate a password guessing attack. These integrated detection rules can expedite threat detection and enable the use of automated responses to certain types of attacks.

### DLP (Data Loss Prevention)

## DLP Meaning

DLP, or Data Loss Prevention, is a [cybersecurity solution](https://www.fortinet.com/solutions) that detects and prevents data breaches. Since it blocks extraction of sensitive data, organizations use it for internal security and regulatory compliance.

DLP enables businesses to detect data loss, as well as prevent the illicit transfer of data outside the organization and the unwanted destruction of sensitive or personally identifiable data (PII). It is also used to help organizations with data security and ensure they comply with regulations like the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).The terms "data loss" and "data leakage prevention" are often used interchangeably, but DLP security enables organizations to defend themselves against both. DLP allows businesses to:

1.  Identify sensitive information across multiple on-premises and cloud-based systems
2.  Prevent the accidental sharing of data
3.  Monitor and protect data
4.  Educate users on how to stay compliant

  

## Why You Need DLP

The threat of data breaches—incidents where protected is stolen, used, or viewed by an unauthorized individual—has rapidly increased as the world became more digital. There were more than [3,800 breaches](https://pages.riskbasedsecurity.com/2019-midyear-data-breach-quickview-report) in the first half of 2019 alone. DLP is a crucial tool in helping businesses protect their data.

  

## How DLP Works

DLP systems protect businesses’ data by identifying sensitive information, then using deep content analysis to detect and prevent potential data leaks. This content analysis uses methods like keyword matches, regular expressions, and internal functions to recognize content that matches a company’s DLP policy. As a result, businesses can identify, monitor, and automatically prevent the theft or exposure of protected data.

### Ips/Ids

## What is an IDS?(Intrusion Detection Systems)

An IDS monitors and detects behavior across a network and should be considered a diagnostic solution. The system, if it detects something problematic, will alert the security team so they can investigate.

## What is an IPS?**(****Intrusion Prevention Systems)**

## 

An IPS has the same functionality as IDS systems in terms of detection but also contains response capabilities. An IPS solution has more agency and takes action when a potential attack, malicious behavior, or an unauthorized user is detected.

The specific functions of an IPS depend on the type of solution, but in general, having an IPS in place is helpful to automate actions and contain threats without the need for an administrator.

## IDS vs. IPS: Similarities and differences

## 

An IDS and an IPS are quite similar, particularly because of their similar detection process. However, their differences will dictate whether an organization opts for one over the other.

### IDS and IPS similarities

## 

Across the two solutions, you can expect a similar level of:

-   Monitoring: Both systems monitor networks, traffic, and activity across devices and servers, varying only in how targeted or broad their capabilities are.

-   Alerting: Upon discovering a potential threat, only an IPS will take the next required step but both solutions first alert you to the discovery and associated action.

-   Learning: Depending on the detection system used by either an IPS or IDS system, both will likely learn to spot suspicious behaviors and minimize false positives.

-   Logging: Both systems will keep an account of what’s monitored and what action has been taken, so you can review performance accordingly.

### IDS and IPS differences

## 

-   Depending on how resourced your security team is, the differences between the systems can be very important:
    
    -   Response: This is the most important difference between the two systems. An IDS will stop at the detection phase, leaving you and your department free to decide what action to take. An IPS, depending on the settings and policy, will take action to try and contain the threat or prevent unauthorized users from embedding themselves further into your network.
    
    -   Protection: Because of the differences listed above, an IPS does offer more protection because it acts automatically, leaving little time for an attacker to continue compromising an organization.
    
    -   Impact: As a side effect of that automation, false positives may negatively impact your organization. An IPS may shut down your network or stop traffic to and from a certain device in the name of precaution and security — even if the threat didn’t require such drastic action (or the alert was a false positive).

## Why both IDS and IPS solutions are critical for cybersecurity

## 

-   -   Organizations shouldn’t necessarily consider choosing one solution over another; both are extremely helpful and many vendors offer an intrusion detection _and_ prevention system, or IDPS, as a solution that provides the benefits of both systems.
        
        [Detection and response capabilities](https://www.varonis.com/blog/edr-security?hsLang=en) have proven to be crucial for organizations to not only know when an attack has reached their perimeter but also to act accordingly. By employing effective detection and response solutions, companies are catching bad actors and reducing dwell time, minimizing the impact these actors can have.
        
        Security leaders should have an understanding of their organization’s needs as well as a list of what data requires monitoring before choosing the right IDS and/or IPS solution. They should also take stock of their own security department to determine whether they want an automated solution, they have an agency to react accordingly, or they’d prefer to have a hybrid approach.
        
        We recommend leveraging both systems or a combination IDPS for effective protection. As organizations grow and scale, additional IDS/IPS solutions may be brought on to account for additional servers, networks, or devices.
